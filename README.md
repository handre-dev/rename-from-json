How to:
1. Run the executable file.
2. Press 'Open Files Folder'. A file explorer windows will show up.
3. Put the files to be renamed in the 'to_rename' folder (Example: 5003.png, 5004.png).
4. Paste the content of your JSON file (Example: [{"id": 5003, "name": "dog"}, {"id": 5004, "name": "cat"}].
5. Enter the source name key (Example: id) and the end name key (Example: name) in the corresponding text areas.
6. Press 'Go'. All the files will be copied in the 'renamed' folder according to your JSON mapping (Example: 5003.png -> dog.png).
